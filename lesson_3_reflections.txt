When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to work colaboratively or to have a copy safely stored away

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I'm not sure about this one, but perhaps so I can keep my workspace stable while I work on it

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks allow you to copy a repository using only github, clones are for working locally and branches are for testing experimental features
